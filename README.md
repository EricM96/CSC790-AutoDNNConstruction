# CSC790-AutoDNNConstruction
Final project for CSC 790: Deep Learning

## Project Description 
We will implementthe method described in [1] and demonstrate its effectiveness in automating the process of 
selecting network architecture and weights. As a starting point we will test the effectiveness of this method against the use of the 
ResNet34 architecture on the MNIST dataset.
